# cpptemplates
My template/algorithm collection for Competitive Programming in C++

The codes above are used by me mostly in programming contests, to save time from reimplementing commonly occuring algorithms/structures.
Note that the codes are written with the intention of my use only, therefore they can be messy - but that's okay - they are only templates to be copied and pasted.
